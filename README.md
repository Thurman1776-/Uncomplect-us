# How much you are complecting your code? 

Complect what? [Rich Hickey explain us what it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oytL881p-nQ&t=1320s) to complect your software. 

This is a tool that intents to help you uncomplect your objects
by giving you an indication of which entities show a large amount of dependencies & how they are intertwined. 

This is basically a re-write of [this project](https://github.com/PaulTaykalo/objc-dependency-visualizer) in Swift 
as a Mac App. 
Currently it is serving me as a way to experiment with newest tech such as SwiftUI. 

The visual representation is quite different from the Ruby project but in the future I plan to have a similar graphical 
representation of dependencies + tons of other useful features. 

This is a very much WIP, however feedback is always welcome!
