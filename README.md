# Do you know how much you are complecting your code? 

This is a Mac App that intents to be a tool to help you [uncomplect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oytL881p-nQ&t=1320s) your objects
by giving you an indication of which entities show a large amount of dependencies. 

This idea is totally taken from [here](https://github.com/PaulTaykalo/objc-dependency-visualizer) but the intention is to take it a step further & make it a tool for developers to track down the most complex objects so it serves
as a metric to prioritise entities breakdowns.
