# How much you are complecting your code? 

Complect what? [Rich Hickey explain us what it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oytL881p-nQ&t=1320s) to complect your software. 

This is a Mac App that intents to be a tool to help you uncomplect your objects
by giving you an indication of which entities show a large amount of dependencies & how they are intertwined. 

This idea is totally taken from [this project](https://github.com/PaulTaykalo/objc-dependency-visualizer) but the intention is to take it a step further & make it a tool for developers to track down the most complex objects so it serves
as a metric to prioritise entities breakdowns. 

This is a very much WIP, however feedback is always welcome!
